1. Make an issue on GitHub describing the bug you intend to fix or the feature you intend to add.
2. Create a fork of the project, and work on a branch that represents the issue
3. Ensure that the work you have done is unit tested, aiming for 80% code coverage
4. Create a PR that represents this work. Please refer to the issue from the PR
5. We will address the PR and give you feedback

Please note that we can not guarantee that all PRs will be merged. There are cases where a PR may deviate from the long-term vision for Terra Draw and hence we may have to decline it. Creating the issue in advance helps us discuss any potential issues upfront before the PR is made.
